<p>I was lucky enough to spend three days visiting Paris this month! I went with a friend and we were able to see many things <br>
  while we were there!</p>
<p><strong>Day 1</strong></p>
<p>On our first day, we started by visiting <em>Montmartre</em> right away. Our second stop was the Eiffel tower (check out that<br>
  beautiful picture!) We ate dinner at a cute little bistro overlooking <em>la Seine</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Day 2</strong></p>
<p>On our second day, we went shopping on <em>Avenue des Champs Elysees</em>. Every single person we saw was dressed in the height <br>
of fashion.</p>
<p>After we finished shopping, we visited some really beautiful places! We went to <em>Notre Dame</em>. We went on a macaron tour of<br>
  Paris and ate all of the best macaroons the city had to offer. After we finished shoppong, we visited <em>le Louvre</em>. </p>

<p><strong>Day 3</strong></p>
<p>The picture below is of me visiting the <em style="">Arc de Triomphe</em>. It's huge! We also went to <em>le Musee D'Orsay</em>. Seeing the work of<br>
  Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh in person was completely breathtaking. I was surprised to see that the museum also had many <br>
  sculptures including those by Aguste Rodin, Paul Gauguin, and Alfred Barye.</p>
